# RPI-Lane-Detection-Autonomous-car
This project implements an autonomous robot that follows lanes and avoids obstacles using a Raspberry Pi 5 and camera module. It utilizes OpenCV for lane detection, YOLO for object detection, and GPIOZero for motor control, enabling real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.
